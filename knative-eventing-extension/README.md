The Knative Eventing Extension for Tekton provides a set of building blocks that allow Knative Eventing sources to trigger Tekton PipelineRuns and TaskRuns. It provides everything you need out-of-the-box to get started and closely follows the eventing discussion in  [Tekton Pipeline](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) to minimize necessary componentry.

In addition to Tekton/Knative Eventing glue, it includes an extension to the Tekton dashboard so that a user can see how the various pieces fit together.
